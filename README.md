Walmart sale prediction during holiday season

This is a solution to one of Walmart sales prediction challenges. High lift was seen during the holiday season. Hence, weights were assigned accordingly in a cyclic manner based on trend of previous years. Two models were run xgboost and linear regression. Linear regression was found to be the better one as it had better R2.
